# ConeSLAM

All code in this project, unless otherwise stated, has been written by Stefan Bjørn Gunnarsson and Janus Nørgaard Syrak Hansen.

The data used in this project can be found on the following website: https://nextcloud.sdu.dk/index.php/s/oCaAxmEwjd9LTEP

This both includes images along with their labelled masks, and point cloud observations and images from a test drive.

The code has been written to run on our local machines, and so, requires some modification to run as-is. If you require any files or tips on how to use, please let me know.
